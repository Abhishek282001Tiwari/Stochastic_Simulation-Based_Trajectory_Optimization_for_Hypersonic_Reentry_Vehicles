# Control Systems Module

This module provides control system components for hypersonic reentry vehicle guidance and navigation.

## Status: Under Development

This module is currently under development and will include:

### Planned Components

1. **Guidance Algorithms**
   - Predictive guidance using numerical predictor-corrector methods
   - Apollo-style guidance with closed-form solutions
   - Adaptive guidance for real-time trajectory updates

2. **Control Laws**
   - Bank angle control for lift vector modulation
   - Angle of attack scheduling for optimal L/D ratios
   - Reaction control system (RCS) modeling

3. **Navigation Systems**
   - Inertial navigation with error modeling
   - GPS integration for position updates
   - Sensor fusion algorithms

4. **Estimation and Filtering**
   - Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for state estimation
   - Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) for nonlinear systems
   - Particle filters for non-Gaussian problems

## Current Implementation

For now, control inputs are handled through the trajectory optimization framework:
- Bank angle and angle of attack are optimization variables
- Control bounds are enforced through optimization constraints
- Optimal control solutions provide reference trajectories

## Future Development

This module will be expanded to include:
- Real-time guidance algorithms
- Closed-loop control system simulation
- Monte Carlo analysis with control system uncertainties
- Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) integration capabilities

## Integration

When complete, this module will integrate with:
- `dynamics.VehicleDynamics` for closed-loop simulation
- `uncertainty.UncertaintyQuantifier` for control system Monte Carlo
- `optimization.TrajectoryOptimizer` for optimal control synthesis

## Usage (Planned)

```python
from hypersonic_reentry.control import GuidanceSystem, ControlLaws

# Create guidance system
guidance = GuidanceSystem(
    guidance_type="predictive",
    target_conditions=target_state,
    vehicle_parameters=vehicle_params
)

# Create control laws
controller = ControlLaws(
    control_type="bank_angle",
    gains=control_gains
)

# Closed-loop simulation
trajectory = dynamics.integrate_trajectory_closed_loop(
    initial_state=initial_state,
    guidance_system=guidance,
    controller=controller,
    time_span=(0.0, 2000.0)
)
```

## Contributing

If you're interested in contributing to control system development:
1. Review current optimization-based approach
2. Identify specific control algorithms to implement
3. Follow existing code patterns and documentation standards
4. Add comprehensive tests for new control components
